# cljs-starter

This follows the setup described in the om.next quick
start [guide](https://github.com/omcljs/om/wiki/Quick-Start-%28om.next%29).

## Usage

To start the figwheel repl, run the following command:
```sh
lein run -m clojure.main scripts/start-figwheel-repl.clj
```

If you are using IntelliJ IDEA + Cursive, the .idea folder 
contains a run configuration which you can use to start the
repl from within IntelliJ. Just run the `FIGWHEEL REPL`
configuration, usually found on the top right.
